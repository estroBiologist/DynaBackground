# DynaBackground
Server-specific backgrounds plugin for BetterDiscord. Intended for use with a theme that supports backgrounds.

## Setup

Easy: just download the JS file and drag it into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. Once it's enabled, use the plugin settings to input a default background URL, and any server-specific URLs. The plugin will load the appropriate background when you switch servers, or the default one if no background is defined for that server. (This includes DMs.)

## Dependencies

Requires [Zere's Plugin Library](https://rauenzi.github.io/BDPluginLibrary/), as well as a theme that supports background images. I used a modified [BasicBackground](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/BasicBackground) while developing this. 

If it doesn't work with your theme, sorry, but if I never have to write JavaScript again it'll be too soon.
